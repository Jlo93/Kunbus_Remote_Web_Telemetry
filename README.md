# Web-Telemetry

A simple dashboard webpage to allow for the monitoring of telemetry generated by remote water pupming station.

The telemtry that is displayed is as follows
	Kunbus controller - digital inputs
	Kunbus controller - digital outputs
	Kunbus controller - Analogs signals - Main Water Line pressue, Pump Sump Level, Diesel Tank Level
  A communication RTU heartbeat that is passed between the controller and the database to ensure connectivity.

System was built using a Kunbus RevPi Industrial PC coded in Python to handle the control of the mains water pump along with the data migration to a firebase real-time database of several signals generated by various sensors. 

Site security was implemented by using sensors to trigger an SMS alarm via the twillio API on the event of a door opening outside of the normal working hours of the site staff, mon-fri 8am-6pm.
